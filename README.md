# NLP-Turkish-text-classification

In the project we developed for the competition, our aim was to focus on developing Turkish-based natural language processing techniques to identify and classify derogatory language in sentences using natural language processing. Our project involves identifying and analyzing language patterns and contextual cues to accurately identify the presence of sexist, racist, disrespectful or derogatory speech. We also focused on this topic as the resulting technical competence can have significant impacts in various industries such as social media platforms, online advertising and customer service.


We implemented the classification problem with the following steps:
* Setup: Importing Libraries
* Loading the data set & Exploratory Data Analysis
* Text pre-processing
* Extracting vectors from text (Vectorization)
* Running ML/DL algorithms
* Conclusion

### Step 2: Loading the data set & EDA

The dataset we used for the project is the (Turkish- ... ) dataset that we use to detect derogatory discourses with natural language processing methods. 

The situation to be determined in the Veristein, there is a derogatory discourse in a text is the situation or not. In other words, it should be guessed as 0 or 1. In addition, if the insulting discourse is predicted, the given subordinate of this discourse breakdown (SEXIST, RACIST, PROFANITY, INSULT) should also be determined.
